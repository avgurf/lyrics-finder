#lyrics-finder

A lyrics search engine, which filters through your Last.FM scrobble
history, using Genius.com API and Last.FM API.

Ever hit shuffle and got stuck with that line from a song about love? What about
that one song with the word 'baby' in it from last week?? Want to find a song
your fiend likes about dogs? Last.FM Lyrics Finder will go though your
Last.FM library and will find songs with your search query in their lyrics :)
